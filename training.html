      <p> &emsp;One-on-One Personal Training:
Come in for an initial assessment to determine your needs based on your goals,<br>health history, exercise experience, etc.  After the assessment I will put you on an exercise program that will be <br>designed for your individual needs. Need help with your dietary habits? I will go over general recommendations<br> and ways to make improvements in your daily nutrition as every good exercise program needs to be accompanied<br> by proper eating habits for optimal success.

The option of individual training allows you to get undivided attention<br> and instruction from a personal trainer, while also creating superior accountability to your program.<br>  Contact Shoot4Results today if you are interested in learning more about my personal training!</p>

        <p>
&emsp;I also perform dual training which resembles one on one training in that you will come in for an<br> initial assessment to determine your needs based on your goals, health history, exercise experience,<br> etc.&nbsp;After the assessment I will put you on an exercise program that will be designed for your <br>individual needs.  But I understand not everyone can afford the cost of individual personal training.<br>

The "dual" option allows you to work out with another client which helps decrease your cost, all<br> while engaging you with a workout partner during your sessions. You can sign-up with someone<br> you know, or get put into any of the regular dual training openings that are available at that time.<br> This option of training allows you to get some one on one attention and instruction from a personal<br> trainer, while sharing the space with a client that is as motivated as you are.</p>
